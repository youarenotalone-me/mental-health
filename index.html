        <p style="font-size: 16px; color: black; font-weight:bold;">Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to
            perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal
            and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our
            daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the
            virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children,
            and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look
            after our mental, as well as our physical, health.</p>

                <p>CBT is based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle.

                    CBT aims to help you deal with overwhelming problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.

        “Mental pain is less dramatic than physical pain, but it is more common and also more hard to bear. The frequent
        attempt to conceal mental pain increases the burden: it is easier to say ‘My tooth is aching than to say ‘My
        heart is broken’.” – C.S. Lewis
